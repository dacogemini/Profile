            So, what is Git in a nutshell? This is an important section to absorb, because if you understand what Git is and the fundamentals
            of how it works, then using Git effectively will probably be much easier for you. As you learn Git, try to clear
            your mind of the things you may know about other VCSs, such as CVS, Subversion or Perforce — doing so will help
            you avoid subtle confusion when using the tool. Even though Git’s user interface is fairly similar to these other
            VCSs, Git stores and thinks about information in a very different way, and understanding these differences will
            help you avoid becoming confused while using it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Snapshots</h3>

            <p>The major difference between Git and any other VCS (Subversion and friends included) is the way Git thinks about
                its data. Conceptually, most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes. These other
                systems (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on) think of the information they store as a set of files
                and the changes made to each file over time (this is commonly described as delta-based version control).
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="file:///C:/Users/dan.CLARKWC/OneDrive/Northwestern/Google_Drive/Images/deltas.png" width="400" height="200" alt="git Delta">
            </p>
            <p>
                Git doesn’t think of or store its data this way. Instead, Git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature
                filesystem. With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture
                of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. To be efficient,
                if files have not changed, Git doesn’t store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it
                has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                This is an important distinction between Git and nearly all other VCSs. It makes Git reconsider almost every aspect of version
                control that most other systems copied from the previous generation. This makes Git more like a mini filesystem
                with some incredibly powerful tools built on top of it, rather than simply a VCS. We’ll explore some of the
                benefits you gain by thinking of your data this way when we cover Git branching in Git Branching.

            <h3>NOTES:</h3>
            <ul>
                <p>
                    <li>One of the most popular VCS tools in use today is called Git</li>
                </p>
                <li>Git is a Distributed VCS (a category known as DVCS)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <h3>git Concepts</h3>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>RESPOSITORY</li>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Think of a repository as a kind of database where your VCS stores all the versions and metadata that accumulate in the course
                    of your project. In Git, the repository is just a simple hidden folder named “.git” in the root directory
                    of your project. Knowing that this folder exists is more than enough. You don‘t have to (and, moreover,
                    should not) touch anything inside this magical folder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>ACCESSING THE REPOSITORY</strong>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If you have a project locally on your computer that is not yet under version control, you can initialize
                        a new repository for this project.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>If you‘re getting on board of a project that‘s already running, chances are there is a repository on
                        a remote server (on the internet or on your local network). You‘ll then probably be provided with
                        a URL to this repository that you will then “clone” (download / copy) to your local computer.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                </ol>
                <p>As soon as you have a local repository, you can start working on your files: modify, delete, add, copy, rename,
                    or move files in whatever

                </p>
                <li>BRANCHING & MERGING</li>
                <br>
                <p>Creating a "branch" in VCS tools keeps multiple streams of work independent from each other while also providing
                    the facility to merge that work back together, enabling developers to verify that the changes on each
                    branch do not conflict.
                </p>
                <li>TRACABILITY</li>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Being able to trace each change made to the software and connect it to project management and bug tracking software such
                    as Jira, and being able to annotate each change with a message describing the purpose and intent of the
                    change can help not only with root cause analysis and other forensics.
                </p>
