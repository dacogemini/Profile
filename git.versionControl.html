        <p>This chapter will be about getting started with Git. We will begin by explaining some background on version control
            tools, then move on to how to get Git running on your system and finally how to get it set up to start working
            with. At the end of this chapter you should understand why Git is around, why you should use it and you should
            be all set up to do so.

        <h2>ABOUT VERSION CONTROL</h2>
        <p>
            <em>
                <strong>What is “version control”, and why should you care?</strong>
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>Version control systems</span> are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source
            code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database.
            If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix
            the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly
            want to), a
            <span>Version Control System (VCS)</span> is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert selected files back
            to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last
            modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also
            generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this
            for very little overhead.
        </p>
        <p>For almost all software projects, the source code is like the crown jewels - a precious asset whose value must be
            protected. For most software teams, the source code is a repository of the invaluable knowledge and understanding
            about the problem domain that the developers have collected and refined through careful effort. Version control
            protects source code from both catastrophe and the casual degradation of human error and unintended consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Software developers working in teams are continually writing new source code and changing existing source code. The code
            for a project, app or software component is typically organized in a folder structure or "file tree". One developer
            on the team may be working on a new feature while another developer fixes an unrelated bug by changing code,
            each developer may make their changes in several parts of the file tree.
        </p>
        <h3>Local Version Control System</h3>
        <p>
            Many people’s version-control
            <span>method of choice is to copy files into another directory</span> (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if they’re
            clever). This approach is very common because it is so simple, but it is also
            <span>incredibly error prone.</span>
            It is easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don’t mean
            to. To deal with this issue, programmers long ago developed local VCSs that had a simple database that kept all
            the changes to files under revision control.</p>
        <img src="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/local.png" width="500" height="400" alt="Revision Control">
        <p>
            <em>One of the more popular VCS tools was a system called RCS, which is still distributed with many computers today.
                RCS works by keeping patch sets (that is, the differences between files) in a special format on disk; it
                can then re-create what any file looked like at any point in time by adding up all the patches.</em>
            <p>
                <h3>Centralized Version Control Systems</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
                The next major issue that people encounter is that they need to collaborate with developers on other systems. To deal with
                this problem, Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs) were developed. These systems, such as CVS, Subversion,
                and Perforce, have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check
                out files from that central place. For many years, this has been the standard for version control.</p>
            <img src="file:///C:/Users/dan.CLARKWC/OneDrive/Northwestern/Google_Drive/Images/centralized.png" width="500" height="400"
                alt="CVCS">
        </p>
        <p>
            This setup offers many advantages, especially over local VCSs. For example, everyone knows to a certain degree what everyone
            else on the project is doing. Administrators have fine-grained control over who can do what, and it’s far easier
            to administer a CVCS than it is to deal with local databases on every client.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, this setup also has some serious downsides. The most obvious is the single point of failure that the centralized
            server represents. If that server goes down for an hour, then during that hour nobody can collaborate at all
            or save versioned changes to anything they’re working on. If the hard disk the central database is on becomes
            corrupted, and proper backups haven’t been kept, you lose absolutely everything — the entire history of the project
            except whatever single snapshots people happen to have on their local machines. Local VCS systems suffer from
            this same problem — whenever you have the entire history of the project in a single place, you risk losing everything.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Distributed Version Control Systems</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            This is where Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) step in. In a DVCS (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs), clients
            don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files; rather, they fully mirror the repository, including its
            full history. Thus, if any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via that server, any of the client
            repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the
            data.

                <br>
                <p>Creating a "branch" in VCS tools keeps multiple streams of work independent from each other while also providing
                    the facility to merge that work back together, enabling developers to verify that the changes on each
                    branch do not conflict.

                    Being able to trace each change made to the software and connect it to project management and bug tracking software such
                    as Jira, and being able to annotate each change with a message describing the purpose and intent of the
                    change can help not only with root cause analysis and other forensics.
